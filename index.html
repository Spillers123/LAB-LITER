                <textarea placeholder="Hi Babi, when you read this message I just wanna let you know that I love you so much, and I'm sorry for how I'am the way I'am
                 most of the time, I'm just really paranoid and traumatized from what I've been through before. Thank you for being patient with me so I really hope
                 that you stay as the most understanding person I know. But let me remind you babi that whenever you lose feelings towards me, have the urge to just
                 to leave me jjust leave me ok, or whenever you find somebody else that you want in your life don't hesitate to choose that person over me. I love
                  you so much and I'm really looking forward to being with you in the future because I want it to be you, nobody else but you in my life.
                  nobody can ever replace what we have because you're my special someone, my other half and everything we could ever be. I hope you know
                  how much I'm scared to lose you, I love you my solace, let's fight for what we have ok? I love you so much"></textarea>
